my website. my rules!!1

in all seriousness, i wanted to make a website by myself since 2014... 8 years later, i finally did it.

this section is mostly to answer some questions (keep in mind the last 2 is jokes)
# "So uhhh... why does this exist?" - Some Average Joe
for my coding things to go public
# "I love your stuff, but isn't there more?? (Github.TheBustine99."thebustine99.github.io".getProjectAmount) seems too little." - A Different Average Joe
some things i made was for fun, and some are still working in progress because of some certain issue. (LOOKING AT YOU, COLLISION IN HTML)
# "When will REAL people ask questions?" - Myself lol
soon™
# "Can I has 🅱️obux?" - Some New Roblox User
no
# "Why no? You has headless!!1 😢😭😭" - The exact same New Roblox User that isn't probably new
no
